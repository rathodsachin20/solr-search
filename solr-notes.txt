Solr can be queried via REST clients cURL, wget, Chrome POSTMAN, etc., as well as via the native clients available for many programming languages. 
The Solr Admin UI includes a query builder interface - see the collection1 query tab at http://localhost:8983/solr/#/collection1/query.
Sample rest query url: http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=*:*&wt=json&indent=true

To restrict fields returned in the response, use the fl param, which takes a comma-separated list of field names.
